# Flat Theme for Zed

A clean, minimalist dark theme for [Zed](https://zed.dev) based on my Flat Theme for VSCode.

## Features

- **Consistent Color Scheme**: Terminal colors match the rest of the IDE for a cohesive experience
- **Clean Flat Design**: Minimal borders for a sleek, modern look
- **Subtle Accents**: The signature teal accent (#94E2D5) provides visual feedback without distraction
- **Highlighted Borders**: Important UI elements like hover messages, errors, and warnings have distinct colored borders inspired by Catppuccin
- **Dark Background**: Easy on the eyes with a dark gray (#202124) background
- **Clear Syntax Highlighting**: Well-balanced color palette for code readability

## What Makes This Different?

This theme addresses common issues found in other dark themes:

1. **Terminal Consistency**: Unlike some themes that leave terminal colors undefined, Flat Theme ensures your terminal matches your editor for a unified experience.

2. **Smart Borders**: Inspired by Catppuccin, hover messages, errors, warnings, and info popups have colored borders that make them instantly recognizable while maintaining the clean flat aesthetic.

3. **No Visual Clutter**: Following the Material Theme Darker philosophy, UI borders are kept minimal. The interface is one clean slate of color, letting your code take center stage.
